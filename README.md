  - Name:Lin ningning,  student number:192050192

#### Laboratory work number:
   Lab1 variant 1
#### Description:
   variant 1: Unrolled linked list (you can use built-in list inside node).

#### Synopsis:  
* add a new element (lst.add(3), cons(lst, 3), extend(lst, 3));  
* remove an element (lst.remove(3), remove(lst, 3));
* size (lst.size(), size(lst));    
* conversion from and to python lists (lst.to_list(), lst.from_list([12, 99, 37]), from_list([12, 99, 37]));   
* find element by specific predicate (lst.find(is_even_), );    
* filter data structure by specific predicate (lst.filter(is_even));   
* map structure by speci?c function (lst.map(increment));   
* reduce-process structure elements to build a return value by speci?c functions (lst.reduce(sum));    
* data structure should be a monoid and implement mempty and mconcat functions or methods;    
* iterator: 
   - for the mutable version in Python style [12, Chapter 7. Classes & Iterators]; 
   - for the immutable version by closure [14], see example ahead.

#### contribution
* contribution summary for each group member (should be checkable by git log and git blame);

#### Explanation：  
  Unrolled linked list is a kind of transformation or improvement of linked list. Each node of it is stored by an array. The capacity of node array is fixed. 1. Insert operation: insert the element after finding the position according to the subscript. If the current inserted node array is full, a new node is created, and half of the elements of the current node are moved to the array of the new node, and the element is inserted finally. 2. Delete: delete the element according to the subscript. A node after deleting an element may need its neighbors to merge. Unrolled linked list has the advantages of random access of array and efficient insertion and deletion of linked list.

#### Work demonstration 
* (how to use developed software, how to test it), should be repeatable by an instructor by given command-line examples:  
  - We write unrolled linked list file and test file on Pycharm.
  - Use terminal to test the code. like 'python Immutable_test.py -v'and 'python test_mutable.py -v'.

#### Conclusion:  
  Mutable version used used list to create a unrolled linked list.In immutable version,we create a new unrolled linked list before modifying each unrolled linked list, and do not change the original linked list.This Lab makes us to realize unrolled linked list and  mutable/immutable version.
